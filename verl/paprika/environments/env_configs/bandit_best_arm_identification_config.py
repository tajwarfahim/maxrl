Each button is associated with a Bernoulli distribution with a fixed but unknown mean; the means for the buttons could be different. For each button, when you press it, you will get a reward that is sampled from the button's associated distribution. You have 20 time steps and, on each time step, you can choose any button and receive the reward. \n\nYour goal is to strategically choose buttons at each time step to collect information about their reward distribution, that will let you choose the button with the highest mean reward correctly at the end of 20 turns.",
